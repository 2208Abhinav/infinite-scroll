### Infinite-Scroll Demos

To run, you will need to contain the project in a web server to allow pages to properly fetch resources.

The simplest way to do this is to use Python's Simple HTTP Server:

##### Python 2.x

```bash
py -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

##### Python 3.x

```bash
py -m http.server
```

From there, navigate to `localhost:8000/demo/simple.html` or to a demo another demo in the directory.
